# OS-final

This Repo contains copies of the files we each worked on as well a distribution of the current branch of Mailpile. All documentation for Mailpile can be found either in their wiki or in the documentation found in the distribution. As well, we have aligned our mission statement and code of conduct with the Mailpile ones, which can also be found in their wiki (specifically the developer portion of the wiki).
