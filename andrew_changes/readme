Andrews Work
All of my changes were made under the setup_magic.py file as requested in the issue report/feature request.

I did my best at implementing the tag reset functionality and all of my changes were in the ResetTags class towards the bottom of the file.

delete_tags
This function is to delete any tags that previously existed

reset_tags
this function is to reset all tags to the factory defaults that exist when mailpile is originally setup by the user

I was never actually able to test this because of the fact that i couldnt actually get any of my emails loaded in (oAuth has been introduced since this project was created
it seems to break their account import) and primarily because it would involve front end work which I have no experience with, but to the best of my knowledge this fits 
the prior structure and methods used in the rest of the code.
