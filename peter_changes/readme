Peters Changes

For fixing issue #2405 for Mailpile, I had to locate down the file where they changed to web-guis design.
Luckily the file was default.css. And using the @media rule to distinguish when the window size reaches a certain size to add extra padding to the nav element, "topbar-nav" 
which would prevent it from disappearing offscreen. 


Using Windows, I had the issue of everytime I closed the server and then turn it on, the server would not let me
back into the program even though I was typing in the password correctly. So, that made is unlikely for me to be
able to fine tune any of the css or page layout.
