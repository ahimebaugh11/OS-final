Peters Changes

For fixing issue #2405 for Mailpile, I had to locate down the file where they changed to web-guis design.
Luckily the file was default.css. And using the @media rule to distinguish when the window size reaches a certain size to add extra padding to the nav element, "topbar-nav" 
which would prevent it from disappearing offscreen.
